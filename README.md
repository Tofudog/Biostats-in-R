### Installing R
#### Windows
1. Download the base R executable: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.1-win.exe
2. Right-click on the executable and select Run as Administrator (only if you know your machine's password)
3. Choose default options, unless you know what you are doing
4. Open R/R<whatever_version> (as of now, R/R-4.2.0)

#### Unix/Linux

#### Mac OS


Your console is the command line. For each time you press 'ENTER' and your statement/command is valid, you command will be executed. For example,
> 3 + 5
then click 'ENTER'
[1] 8

If you want to write and run an entire script, click File >> New script. After writing code, CTRL+S and save as file_name.r.
On the console, type 'source(filename.r)'. This will execute your entire r source file!
